# simple-fullscreen-navmenu
Just a simple fullscreen navmenu made with scss, html, javascript, GSAP and love.
This is the first little code I published. It's not something big, not something "amazing", but yeah. I thought someone else could find a use to it.
(might add bootstrap icons later) 
## Enjoy!
